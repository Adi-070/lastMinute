## Overview

Need for a reservation/booking website?

    1) Customer Convenience: Customers appreciate the convenience of being able to book appointments or reservations online. 
       It saves them time and allows them to plan their schedules more effectively.
       
    2) Scalability: As a business grows, a reservation site can scale with it, 
       accommodating a larger volume of reservations and customers without a significant increase in administrative work. 
       
    3) Health and Safety: In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, reservation systems have become even more critical for businesses
       that need to manage occupancy limits and implement social distancing measures.
